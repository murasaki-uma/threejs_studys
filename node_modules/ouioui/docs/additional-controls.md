### Additional Controls

The basic controllers cover all data types, but sometimes your data describes something more complicated such as a rotation, or a color, or a 2 dimensional vector. In these situations there's an additional set of controllers you can import that override Oui's default behaviour. Install them and you can use [color pickers](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#ColorPicker), [xypads](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#XYPad), [graphs](http://marklundin.github.io/core-controllers/documentation/#Graph) and more.
You simply annotate a property with a type controller.
